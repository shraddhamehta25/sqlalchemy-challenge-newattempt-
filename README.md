app.py
Purpose: This file serves as the main Flask application for the climate app.
Functionality:
Sets up routes to handle various API requests.
Defines functions to retrieve and process data from the database.
Converts data into JSON format and returns it as API responses.
Handles requests for precipitation data, station information, temperature observations, and temperature statistics for a given date range.
Runs the Flask app.
climate_starter.ipynb
Purpose: This Jupyter Notebook file provides a starter template for analyzing climate data using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
Functionality:
Connects to the SQLite database containing climate data.
Uses SQLAlchemy ORM queries to perform data analysis and exploration.
Conducts a precipitation analysis, station analysis, and temperature analysis.
Calculates summary statistics for precipitation and temperature data.
Plots precipitation and temperature data using Matplotlib.
Provides step-by-step instructions for setting up Flask routes based on the analysis results.
Demonstrates how to design Flask routes for accessing precipitation data, station information, temperature observations, and temperature statistics.
In summary, app.py is the Flask application responsible for serving API requests, while climate_starter.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook providing a guide for analyzing climate data and designing Flask routes based on the analysis.
